&&&&&&&&&&&& HTML Block and Inline Elements &&&&&&&&&&&&&Block-level Elements
--Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.
--There are two display values: block and inline.

Block-level Elements
--A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
--A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
--Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.
1)The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.
2)The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

1)Inline Elements
--An inline element does not start on a new line.
--An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
--This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.
eg
<span>Hello World</span>

2)The <div> Element
--The <div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.
--The <div> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
--When used together with CSS, the <div> element can be used to style blocks of content.
eg
<div style="background-color:black;color:white;padding:20px;">
  <h2>London</h2>
  <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
</div>

3)The <span> Element
--The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.
--The <span> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
--When used together with CSS, the <span> element can be used to style parts of the text.
eg
<p>My mother has <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">blue</span> eyes and my father has <span style="color:darkolivegreen;font-weight:bold;">dark green</span> eyes.</p>
